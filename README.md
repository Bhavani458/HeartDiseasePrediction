# Exploring Vital Health Factors in Heart Disease Risk Assessment

## Description

The Heart Disease UCI dataset comprises 303 observations and 14 attributes (including the target variable). Each observation represents a patient, and the attributes provide information about the patient's demographic, clinical, and diagnostic features.

Understanding the role of age and key health factors, such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and resting blood pressure, in influencing the risk of heart disease is crucial for effective prevention and management strategies.

## Research Question

To what extent do age, gender and key health factors, such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and resting blood pressure, individually contribute to the risk of heart disease?

Does gender, age and the maximum heart rate achieved play a significant role in the occurrence of heart disease?

**Literature Review:**

Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with age and health factors playing pivotal roles in its development and progression. Advancing age is a non-modifiable risk factor associated with increased susceptibility to cardiovascular events (D'Agostino et al., 2008; Lloyd-Jones et al., 2006). Additionally, health factors such as elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking are implicated in heart disease pathogenesis (Yusuf et al., 2004). Gender disparities in heart disease prevalence, presentation, and outcomes have been documented, highlighting the need for gender-sensitive approaches to risk assessment and diagnosis (Hemingway & Marmot, 1999). Interestingly, maximum heart rate achieved during exercise has emerged as a physiological factor influencing heart disease risk, with gender-specific associations observed (Gupta et al., 2020). Understanding the complex interplay between these factors is essential for advancing heart disease research and improving preventive and therapeutic interventions.

## Hypothesis

**Hypothesis for Research Question 1:**

Higher blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart disease, while controlling for age and gender.

Elevated cholesterol levels significantly impact the risk of heart disease, while controlling for age and gender.

Elevated blood pressure levels have a significant effect on the risk of heart disease, while controlling for age and gender.

**Hypothesis for Research Question 2:**

Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise have significant association with the occurrence of heart disease, while controlling for age and gender
